# 🌍 Soma Membership Portal  
**📊 Business Analysis Portfolio Project**

## 👋 Overview
The Soma Membership Portal is a digital transformation initiative designed to support the Somalian migrant community in New Zealand. The project replaces a manual, paper-based membership process with a secure, scalable online platform.

This repository demonstrates my end-to-end **Business Analysis capability**, from problem definition through to solution requirements and delivery planning.
