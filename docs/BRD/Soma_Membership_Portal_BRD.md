## 1. Executive Summary

Due to the rapid growth of the Somalian migrant community in New Zealand, the organisation requires a modern and efficient digital solution that allows members to contribute regardless of geographical location.

The Soma Membership Portal will replace the current paper-based process with an online system that enables members to:
- Register online
- Request loans
- Transfer money internationally
- Access financial support
- Engage with community projects

The target launch timeline is eight months, with a pilot release in October and a go-live date of **1 December 2024**.

---

## 2. Business Objectives

- Achieve **500 registered members** within the first year of launch  
- Enable seamless online registration with minimal manual intervention  
- Integrate automated lending and international money transfer services  
- Generate and update monthly operational and financial reports  

---

## 3. Need Statement

### Ideal State
A fully functional, automated membership portal aligned with the organisation’s objectives in New Zealand.

### Current State
The current process is highly manual, location-dependent, and paper-based. It requires human input at every step, making it inefficient and error-prone as the organisation scales.

### Consequences
Failure to deliver this project on time and within budget will limit the organisation’s ability to achieve its core objectives.

### Proposed Solution
A digital membership portal that allows members to self-register and access financial and community services online.
